### About me

My name is Sarah Ndianekwu, I am a full stack developer. As a software developer with 2 years of experience, I have gained a solid foundation in software development principles and have practical experience creating a variety of software applications using programming languages such as C, JavaScript, and Python. 

I have experience with tools and frameworks such as Git, React, and Angular, and am familiar with agile development methodologies like Scrum and Lean. I have a strong understanding of software design patterns and architecture principles, and am able to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code. In addition, I have experience with testing and debugging techniques, including unit testing and integration testing, and am skilled at troubleshooting and debugging code. 

I am a strong problem-solver with good communication and collaboration skills, and am able to work effectively in a team environment. I am seeking opportunities to continue learning and expanding my skills and knowledge in the field, and am eager to contribute to the development of complex software systems.
